# odin-recipes
It’s time to practice HTML. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty when it's finished, but it’s aim is just to practice HTML; this will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
